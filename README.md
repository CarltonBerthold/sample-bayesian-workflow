# sample-bayesian-workflow
This repository is intended to provide an example of a simple bayesian workflow
including data cleaning, imputation of missing values, model specification,
model criticism, and data visualization.

This project was developed as part of the final assessment for PSYC 4960:
Bayesian Data Analysis at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) and is made
publicly available following my completion of the course. While this repository
falls under an MIT license, reuse of any materials contained within for
assignments pertaining to this course is prohibited and may result in an
academic integrity violation.

This code accompanies the following [paper](<Docs/Bayesian Linear Regression Based Determination of Relevant Correlates of Exam Performance.pdf>)
which formally reports the analyses conducted via the R script. All generated
plots and graphics are also presented within. The data used for these analysis
are synthetic and were sourced from kaggle
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors/data).

The code can be downloaded and run as-is to reproduce the results reported in
the included paper. A copy of the dataset is included in the [Data](Data)
folder and the script expects to find this folder one level above the directory
where student_performance_analyis.R is located. It is reccomended to simply
download the repository and run the script.
